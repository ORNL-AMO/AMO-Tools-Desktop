            <small class="text-muted"> This drop-down selection menu allows the user to define whether the equipment is
                direct driven by the motor or
                belt-driven. There
                are three options for belt drives: V-Belt, Notched V-Belt and Synchronous Belt Drives. Of the three,
                V-Belt
                drives
                are the least efficient, Notched V-Belts are slightly better, and Synchronous Belts are the most
                efficient
                belts.
                <br> This value is used in the Load Estimation calculation. Note: The current estimating method should
                NOT be
                used if
                adjustable frequency drives are used.
