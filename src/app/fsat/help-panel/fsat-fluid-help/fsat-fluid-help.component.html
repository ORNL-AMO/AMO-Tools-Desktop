        Select either 'Air' or 'Other Gases' depending on the type of gas. If using other gases, several fields (Gas Relative Density,
        Specific Heat on the Fluid page and Specific Heat Ratio and Comprehensibility Factor in Field Data) will need to
        be reviewed, as they default to the values for standard air. 
        <br>For Standard Air, the gas density is 0.075 lbm/ft<sup>3</sup>.

        Method to Establish Gas Density has 4 options for the determination of gas density: using relative humidity, wet bulb temperature,
        dew point temperature or already knowing the gas density. Choose which option is appropriate for what is known.

      Wet Bulb Temperature

        The lowest temperature that is achieved by using evaporative cooling on a water-soaked surface. Read using a thermometer
        covered in a water-soaked cloth over which air is passed, such as a sling psychrometer. When obtaining Wet Bulb temperature,
        care should be taken to assure an air velocity of 700 â€“ 2000 ft/min (3.6-10.2 m/s) over the wet bulb and that evaporative
        equilibrium has been attained.</small>
