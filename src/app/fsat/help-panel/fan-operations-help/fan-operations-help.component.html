          Per unit cost of electricity in ($/kWh).
          <hr>The simplest approach is to simply divide the monthly (or annual) electric energy cost by the corresponding period's
          energy consumption, both of which are normally included in electric bills. It is recommended to include demand charges,
          power factor-related penalties, and other issues because they can have a significant impact on the the average per
          unit energy cost.
