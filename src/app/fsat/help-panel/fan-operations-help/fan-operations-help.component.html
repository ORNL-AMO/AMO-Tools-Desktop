          Per unit cost of electricity in ($/kWh).
          <hr>The simplest approach is to simply divide the monthly (or annual) electric energy cost by the corresponding period's
          energy consumption, both of which are normally included in electric bills. It is recommended to include demand charges,
          power factor-related penalties, and other issues because they can have a significant impact on the the average per
          unit energy cost.

          It also helps to calculate the emissions fuel use for transportation. Select the emission source type to select the emission from combustion fuel, biofuel, refrigerant charge, purchased gases, purchased electricity from the grid. 
          Next select the emission source and corresponding fuel type. For calculating emission from purchased electricity from the grid select Electricity under Emission Source Type.
          Enter the facility’s eGrid region for electricity. The emission output rate can be edited but will return to the default value when the electricity/fuel options are changed. 
          Emission Output Rates were obtained from the EPA and the Electronic Code of Federal Regulations.
