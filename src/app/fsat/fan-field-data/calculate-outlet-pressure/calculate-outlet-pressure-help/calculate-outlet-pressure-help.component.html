    Estimate Outlet Pressure
    <br>
    <small class="text-muted">
      This calculator is to estimate outlet pressure when outlet pressure cannot be directly measured, by estimating potential
      pressure losses. Losses can be estimated using information from fan/accessory manufacturers or by consulting references
      such as AMCA Publication 201 – Fans and Systems.

      Fan Outlet System Effect Equivalent Loss
      <br>
      <small class="text-muted">
        Loss in pressure due to system effects. Duct turns at the outlet of the fan result in adverse aerodynamics, referred to as
        system effects (causing non-uniform loading of fan impeller, swirling flow, inability to develop a uniform flow profile
        on discharge). To minimize system effect loss, minimize the number of curves in the outlet ductwork.
