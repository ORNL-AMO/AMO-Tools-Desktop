    Estimate Inlet Pressure
    <br>
    <small class="text-muted">
      This calculator is to estimate inlet pressure when inlet pressure cannot be directly measured, by estimating potential pressure
      losses. Losses can be estimated using information from fan/accessory manufacturers or by consulting references such
      as AMCA Publication 201 – Fans and Systems.

      Air Treatment Loss

        Pressure loss due to inlet air treatment, such as a mist eliminator (removes the rain from incoming fresh air before entering
        the air handling unit). Poor treatment of incoming air leads to wet filters and an increase in pressure loss.

      Flow Measurement Loss

        Pressure losses due to a measuring air flow. Common flow measurement techniques can disrupt inlet air flow and reduce pressure.

      Inlet System Effect Loss
      <br>
      <small class="text-muted">
        Loss in pressure due to system effects. Duct turns at the inlet of the fan result in adverse aerodynamics, referred to as
        system effects (causing non-uniform loading of fan impeller, swirling flow, inability to develop a uniform flow profile
        on discharge). To minimize system effect loss, minimize the number of curves in the inlet ductwork.
