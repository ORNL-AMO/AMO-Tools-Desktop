      Enter data about the energy of processing heating equipment based on metered fuel use. This allows the user to
      compare PHAST
      calculations to the meter data of the equipment. This method calculates total energy used by a furnace by
      multiplying
      metered fuel energy used by the measurement period (hours/days/weeks).
