      Average Specific Heat of Gas
      <br>
      <small class="text-muted">
        Amount of heat per unit mass required to raise the temperature by one degree. For most materials, specific heat
        changes with temperature. At low temperatures, this change is negligible and it can be assumed that specific
        heat is constant across the temperature differential. At higher temperatures, the material's specific heat
        increase is more substantial. This makes heat loss or heat demand calculations difficult. As MEASUR does not
        take this change into account, it is recommended that an average value of specific heat for a certain
        temperature range is used. MEASUR provides an default value for several materials.
