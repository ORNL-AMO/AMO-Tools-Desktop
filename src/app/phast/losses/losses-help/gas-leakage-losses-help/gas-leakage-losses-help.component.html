      Furnace Draft Pressure

        Furnace pressure measured at the level of the opening. It is measured by using an inclined tube manometer or a digital gage.
        Units of measurement is in terms of inch water column. Hot gases leak out when the pressure is positive.

      Savings Suggestions

      <small class="text-muted">
        Eliminate or reduce size of the openings. Use appropriate cover or shield for the openings
        <br> Control/maintain furnace pressure as close to zero as possible
        <br> Avoid excessive positive pressure or presence of openings to reduce or eliminate hot gas leaks from the furnace
