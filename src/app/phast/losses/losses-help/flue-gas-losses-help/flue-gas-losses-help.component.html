        The excess air value represents excess air used in burners plus all air entering the furnace and going as flue gases form the furnace. 
        The value is expressed in terms of percentage of stoichiometric air required for the fuel used and can be calculated as the difference 
        between the measured O<sub>2</sub> and stoichiometric O<sub>2</sub> divided by the stoichiometric O<sub>2</sub>. 
        <br>
        This should be minimized while still ensuring adequate air for complete combustion.
