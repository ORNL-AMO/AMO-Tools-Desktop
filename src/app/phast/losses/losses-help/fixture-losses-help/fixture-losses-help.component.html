      Material Name
      <br>
      <small class="text-muted">
        Type of material used as a fixture within the heating equipment or reaction chamber The word fixture is used to
        represent
        fixtures, trays, baskets, conveyor belt, etc. used for material handling during the heating process. To add a
        new
        material, click "Add New Material". You can "start with existing material" and edit the material properties or
        add
        a completely new material. You cannot use the name of a material already in the database.

      Average Specific Heat of Material
      <br>
      <small class="text-muted">
        Amount of heat per unit mass required to raise the temperature by one degree. For most materials, specific heat
        changes with temperature. At low temperatures, this change is negligible and it can be assumed that specific
        heat is constant across the temperature differential. At higher temperatures, the material's specific heat
        increase is more substantial. This makes heat loss or heat demand calculations difficult. As MEASUR does not
        take this change into account, it is recommended that an average value of specific heat for a certain
        temperature range is used. MEASUR provides an default value for several materials.
