          Losses are based on the the assumption that Wind Velocity is 5 mph and the Surface Shape / Orientation Factor is 1.0. For
          other conditions please use "Wall Loss" Section.
          <br> Eliminate, reduce or insulate hot parts (such as rolls, shafts, sticking, support components) that are sticking
          out of the furnace.
          <hr> Note: These energy saving measures are for guidance only. Not all measures are applicable under all operating conditions.
          There may additional measures when considering specific situations and the user is encouraged to review and apply
          the appropriate measures.

        Average temperature for the exposed areas. The average should be calculated based on actual measurement at several locations
        for the exposed parts or areas. The actual temperature can vary over a wide range and care should be taken to use
        weighted average. Use infra-red radiation temperature measurement instrument (with proper emissivity correction)
        whenever possible.

      Emissivity of the Source
      <br>
      <small class="text-muted">
        The emissivity of a material is a measure of its effectiveness in emitting thermal radiation (heat). It is a
        non-dimensional ratio of the radiant exitance of the surface to the radiant exitance of a black body.
        <hr>
        Many unpainted furnaces are made of materials with an emissivity of 0.9, this is a good first estimate. A
        good rule of thumb: the darker the material - the higher the emissivity.
