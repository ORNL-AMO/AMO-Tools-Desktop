      Air Heating Using Flue Gas Help
      <br>
      <small class="text-muted">
        This calculator can be used to estimate maximum air flow that can be heated by using exhaust gas heat of flue gases from a furnace, oven, or boiler. 
        The hot air can be used as a makeup air for buildings during cold weather months or 
        it can be used as heated makeup air for ovens or other processes.  It is necessary to know cold air entering 
        the heat recovery unit and the desired hot air temperature; leaving the heat recovery unit or a heat exchanger.  
        It is also necessary to know the details of operation of the oven or furnace from where the hot exhaust gases are used.
