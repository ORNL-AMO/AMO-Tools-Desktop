      Air Heating Using Flue Gas Help
      <br>
      <small class="text-muted">
        This calculator can be used to estimate maximum air flow that can be heated by using exhaust gas heat of flue gases from a furnace, oven, or boiler. 
        The hot air can be used as a makeup air for buildings during cold weather months or 
        it can be used as heated makeup air for ovens or other processes.  It is necessary to know cold air entering 
        the heat recovery unit and the desired hot air temperature; leaving the heat recovery unit or a heat exchanger.  
        It is also necessary to know the details of operation of the oven or furnace from where the hot exhaust gases are used.

        Excess Air
        <br>
        <small class="text-muted">
          The excess air value represents excess air used in burners plus all air entering the furnace and going as flue gases form the furnace. 
          The value is expressed in terms of percentage of stoichiometric air required for the fuel used and can be calculated as the difference 
          between the measured O<sub>2</sub> and stoichiometric O<sub>2</sub> divided by the stoichiometric O<sub>2</sub>. 
          <br>
          This should be minimized while still ensuring adequate air for complete combustion. 
          The absolute maximum value depends on the fuel, with some natural gas mixes near 500% and coal closer to 100%.

          Higher O<sub>2</sub> in the exhaust indicates higher excess air and a greater amount of heat contained within the flue gas (lowering the available heat). 
          <br>
          Flue gas O<sub>2</sub> (dry basis) reading is taken at the same location where flue gas temperature is measured to maintain accuracy of the calculations. 
          For many applications this is less than 10%, though a few systems (e.g., thermal oxidizers, paint shop ovens) it may be higher, but still below 21%.
