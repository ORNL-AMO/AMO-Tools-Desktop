      Atmosphere Losses Help

      <small class="text-muted">
        This calculator can be used to calculate fuel savings due to changes the use of inert atmosphere for a heating
        system such as boiler or furnace. Heat is lost by bringing in cooler inert atmosphere to makeup for atmosphere
        lost during operation.
        Actual energy savings or fuel input reduction depends on combustion efficiency or available heat of the heating
        system.

        <small class="text-muted">
          Amount of heat per unit mass required to raise the temperature by one degree. For most materials, specific heat
          changes with temperature. At low temperatures, this change is negligible and it can be assumed that specific
          heat is constant across the temperature differential. At higher temperatures, the material's specific heat
          increase is more substantial. This makes heat loss or heat demand calculations difficult. As MEASUR does not
          take this change into account, it is recommended that an average value of specific heat for a certain
          temperature range is used. MEASUR provides an default value for several materials.
