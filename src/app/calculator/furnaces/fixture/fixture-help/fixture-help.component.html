    Fixture Loss Help
    <br>
    <small class="text-muted">
      A number of methods are used for material handling in a heating equipment such as a furnace, oven, dryer, kiln etc. Examples of fixtures, 
      material handling equipment, include conveyors, belts, trays etc. The fixtures enter at the front (charge) end and exit at the back (discharge) end 
      of the heating equipment, and must be heated along with the load. In some cases heating of fixtures can take a large percentage of the total heat used 
      in the heating equipment. It may be possible to reduce weight of the fixture, change material of the fixture or even change the temperature of the 
      fixture at the entry by returning hot fixture or preheat the fixture.Actual energy savings or fuel input reduction depends on combustion efficiency or available heat of the heating system.

        add
        a completely new material. You cannot use the name of a material already in the database.

      Average Specific Heat of Material
      <br>
      <small class="text-muted">
        Amount of heat per unit mass required to raise the temperature by one degree. For most materials, specific heat
        changes with temperature. At low temperatures, this change is negligible and it can be assumed that specific
        heat is constant across the temperature differential. At higher temperatures, the material's specific heat
        increase is more substantial. This makes heat loss or heat demand calculations difficult. As MEASUR does not
        take this change into account, it is recommended that an average value of specific heat for a certain
        temperature range is used. MEASUR provides an default value for several materials.
