      <small class="text-muted">
        This calculator can be used to calculate fuel savings resulting from cooling a heating system such as boiler or furnace. A cooling medium (either liquid or gas) is used to remove heat from the system. The heat transfer is dependent on the specific heat and flow rate of the cooling medium, as well as the temperature change.
        <br><br>
        Actual energy savings or fuel input reduction depends on combustion efficiency or available heat of the heating system.
