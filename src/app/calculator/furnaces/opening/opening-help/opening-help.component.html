      Opening Losses Help
      <br>
      <small class="text-muted">
        This calculator can be used to calculate fuel savings resulting from closing or reducing opening size in a heating system such as boiler or furnace. Heat is lost by radiation through an opening in the boiler or furnace walls, roof, doors etc. Heat loss from an opening depends primarily on the opening size (i.e. diameter for a round or cylindrical opening and length and height of a square or rectangular opening. The wall thickness also affects the opening loss. To calculate radiation heat loss from an opening it is necessary to calculate a parameter called "radiation view factor (VF)" . Value of radiation VF depends on the geometry of the opening and wall thickness. The opening can be a fixed opening that remains open 100% of the operating time or a certain percentage of the operating time as in case of a furnace door opening when the material is charged and/or discharged.
Actual energy savings or fuel input reduction depends on combustion efficiency or available heat of the heating system.

        <small class="text-muted">
          <br>
          The gross quantity of heat released within a combustion chamber minus both the dry flue gas loss and the moisture loss. 
          It represents the quantity of heat remaining for useful purposes (and to balance losses to walls, openings, and conveyors).
          <br><br>
          More simply, available heat is the fraction of the heat available to be used over the fuel heat input into the system.

          Available heat can be estimated via charts (https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2014/05/f16/check_burner_air2.pdf) or calculated.
          MEASUR can help estimate the available heat if several parameters are known (such as, excess air or oxygen in flue and flue, fuel, and combustion air temperatures).
          <br> <br>      
          This is used to estimate the true amount of fuel wasted for a given heat loss.  If only wanting to estimate the heat lost directly, set available heat to 100%.

          The emissivity of a material is a measure of its effectiveness in emitting thermal radiation (heat). It is a
          non-dimensional ratio of the radiant exitance of the surface to the radiant exitance of a black body.
          <hr>
          Many unpainted furnaces are made of materials with an emissivity of 0.9, this is a good first estimate. A
          good rule of thumb: the darker the material - the higher the emissivity.
