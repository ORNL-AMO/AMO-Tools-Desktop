      Preheating of load or charge material by using heat of flue gases is one of the most efficient methods of heat
      recovery and energy efficiency improvement. The load or
      charge material is heated in the front section of a furnace or oven where hot gases transfer heat to the load
      before leaving the furnace. In some cases a separate
      preheater is installed in which the load is heated by circulating hot flue gases before they are discharged. Load
      preheating also offers an opportunity to increase
      production or throughput if required. Actual energy savings or fuel input reduction depends on combustion
      efficiency or available heat of the heating system.

      Specific Heat of Vapor
      <br>
      <small class="text-muted">
        Amount of heat per unit mass required to raise the temperature by one degree. For most materials, specific heat
        changes with temperature. At low temperatures, this change is negligible and it can be assumed that specific
        heat is constant across the temperature differential. At higher temperatures, the material's specific heat
        increase is more substantial. This makes heat loss or heat demand calculations difficult. As MEASUR does not
        take this change into account, it is recommended that an average value of specific heat for a certain
        temperature range is used. MEASUR provides an default value for several materials.
