    Heat Cascading from High Temperature Process to Lower Temperature Process Help
    <br>
    <small class="text-muted">
      This calculator can be used to estimate energy and related cost savings when exhaust gases from a higher
      temperature (primary) process heating equipment is used to supply heat to lower temperature (secondary) process
      heating equipment. The energy savings result from reduction of heat supply for the secondary process. This is a
      very attractive method of energy saving, however several issues must be considered before application of this
      method. They include matching of heat supply and heat use timing or schedule, distance between primary and
      secondary process equipment, quality of gases from primary process - they must be free of any contamination such
      as particulates, chemicals, organic or inorganic material vapors etc. In general, this method should be considered
      for a continuous process line in which primary and secondary processes are running at the same time and the
      loading (production) rate is constant.

      Available Heat
      <small class="text-muted">
        <br>
        The gross quantity of heat released within a combustion chamber minus both the dry flue gas loss and the
        moisture loss.
        It represents the quantity of heat remaining for useful purposes (and to balance losses to walls, openings, and
        conveyors).
        <br><br>
        More simply, available heat is the fraction of the heat available to be used over the fuel heat input into the
        system.

        <br><br>
        Available heat can be estimated via charts
        (https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2014/05/f16/check_burner_air2.pdf) or calculated.
        MEASUR can help estimate the available heat if several parameters are known (such as, excess air or oxygen in
        flue and flue, fuel, and combustion air temperatures).
        <br> <br>
        This is used to estimate the true amount of fuel wasted for a given heat loss. If only wanting to estimate the
        heat lost directly, set available heat to 100%.
