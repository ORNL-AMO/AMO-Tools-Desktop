                  Maintain appropriate level of oxygen in stack gases by controlling air-fuel ratio for the burners.

                  Maintain and control burner operations to eliminate formation of soot or combustible gases such as carbon

                  Consider use of heat recovery from stack gases. Consider use of various methods of heat recovery to reduce
                  stack
                  gas temperature leaving the heating system.
                </li>

                  Use recuperators or regenerators to preheat combustion air
                </li>
                <li>
                  Where appropriate, consider use of oxygen enrichment of combustion air to reduce mass of stack gases.

                <li>
                  Review process temperature settings and lower it where possible during part-load operations. This can reduce
                  stack gas temperature leaving the heating system.
