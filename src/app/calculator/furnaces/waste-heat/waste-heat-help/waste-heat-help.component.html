              This tool is used to calculate energy savings and economics when exhaust gas (waste) heat is used 
              to provide energy for an absorption chiller.  The absorption chiller system can be used to replace
              an existing mechanical compressor based chiller system that uses electricity. In the waste heat 
              driven system a heat exchanger is used to heat water using heat of exhaust gases from heating 
              equipment such as a furnace, oven, heater, kiln, boiler etc.   The calculator requires data on 
              exhaust gases (standard flue gas analysis or FGA) as well as water flow and inlet and outlet 
              conditions as required by the chiller supplier.  Use of absorption chiller requires cooling 
              water supply for the condenser part of the system.  In most cases it is necessary to have surplus 
              cooling tower capacity or installation of a water cooling system such as a cooling tower or air 
              to water heat exchanger (dry cooler).  Overall economics must include cost of the absorption chiller 
              system, its installation and cost of installing and connecting a water cooling system. The calculator gives 
              savings in electricity, its cost and equivalent fuel energy savings as well as reduction in CO2 
              emission corresponding to electrical energy saving.

        Available Heat
        <small class="text-muted">
          <br>
          The gross quantity of heat released within a combustion chamber minus both the dry flue gas loss and the moisture loss. 
          It represents the quantity of heat remaining for useful purposes (and to balance losses to walls, openings, and conveyors).
          <br><br>
          More simply, available heat is the fraction of the heat available to be used over the fuel heat input into the system. 
          <br><br>

          </div>
          </span>
          <br><br>
          Available heat can be estimated via charts (https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2014/05/f16/check_burner_air2.pdf) or calculated.
          MEASUR can help estimate the available heat if several parameters are known (such as, excess air or oxygen in flue and flue, fuel, and combustion air temperatures).
          <br> <br>      
          This is used to estimate the true amount of fuel wasted for a given heat loss.  If only wanting to estimate the heat lost directly, set available heat to 100%.
