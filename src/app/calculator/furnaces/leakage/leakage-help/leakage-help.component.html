        Air leak losses occur when there is a pressure different between inside the furnace and outside.
        Colder air can leak into a furnace or oven when the inside pressure in the furnace is less than the outside pressure. This air is ultimately discharged as part 
        of hot exhaust gas or flue gas. Energy required to heat the air leaked into the furnace/oven has to be supplied by the burner. 
        The air leaks can be reduced or eliminated by adjusting the furnace inside pressure (less negative or ideally zero) 
        and/or reducing or eliminating the opening size. An automatic pressure control system is often used for large installations and manual 
        pressure adjustment is used for smaller installations. The most cost effective method is to eliminate or reduce opening size if possible.
        <br><br>
        Hot gases leak out from a furnace or an oven when the inside pressure in the furnace is higher than the ambient pressure. The hot 
        gases could be at a higher temperature than the temperature of flue gases discharged. The temperature at the discharge could be 
        lower due to the location of the exhaust gas discharge or due to presence of a heat recovery device such as a recuperator or a 
        regenerator installed to recover part of the flue gas heat. In either case it is possible to reduce heat loss and save energy by reducing the volume or mass flow hot gases. 
        The air hot gas leaks can be reduced or eliminated by adjusting the furnace inside pressure (less positive or ideally zero) and/or reducing or eliminating the opening size. 
        An automatic pressure control system is often used for large installations and manual pressure adjustment is used for smaller installations. The most cost effective method is to eliminate or reduce opening size if possible.

        Actual energy savings or fuel input reduction depends on combustion efficiency or available heat of the heating system.
