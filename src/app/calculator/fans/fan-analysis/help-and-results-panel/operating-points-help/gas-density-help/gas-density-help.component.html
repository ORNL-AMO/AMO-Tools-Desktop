    <small class="text-muted">This section establishes a gas density as a reference to establish the gas density within the fan. The location for which
      base gas density data is inputted could be one of the Planar Locations 1 through 5, or for an alternate location outside
      of Planes Nos. 1 through 5 such as in the plant general spaces or the outdoors (i.e. if the fan draws ambient air from
      plant spaces or the outdoors).
