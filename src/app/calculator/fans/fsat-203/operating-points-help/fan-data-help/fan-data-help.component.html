        <hr> This requires the user to enter data about the overall system (any system effects to take into consideration) and
        any pressure drops between the fan inlet/outlet and the points of measurement. If the user can measure the static
        pressure of the fan inlet or outlet directly, this pressure loss is zero and values for static pressure should be
        entered on planes 4 or 5.
