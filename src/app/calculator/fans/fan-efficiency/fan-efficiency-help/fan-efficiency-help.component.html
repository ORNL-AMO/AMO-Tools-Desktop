      Fan Type
      <br>
      <small class="text-muted">
        Fan Type represents what style of fan is being used based off the listings in the AMCA 201 Standard. This value will be used
        to estimate achievable fan efficiencies based on fan style and operating conditions when automatically optimizing.
        The Specified Efficiency option allows the user to input a fan efficiency to use when optimizing, this does not affect
        the efficiency calculated for the baseline.

      Fan Speed

        The operating or nameplate speed at which the fan is running at. Used along with the measure/required flow rate, head, and
        number of stages, to calculate the fan specific speed. The specific speed is used to determine efficiency penalty
        associated with the fan application, when using the optimization capability.
