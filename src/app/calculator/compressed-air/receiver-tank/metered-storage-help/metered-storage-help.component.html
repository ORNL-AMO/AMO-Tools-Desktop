      In metered control, the rate of compressed air flowing to refill a secondary receiver is controlled. If the rate is not controlled,
      filling the receiver will become a demand event that may cause system problems due to high rate of flow. This is done
      to protect the entire system from intermittent application, which can cause header pressure fluctuations when it actuates.
      Here the storage volume is calculated and installed in the same manner as for protecting a critical application, but
      a needle valve is installed instead of a check valve.
