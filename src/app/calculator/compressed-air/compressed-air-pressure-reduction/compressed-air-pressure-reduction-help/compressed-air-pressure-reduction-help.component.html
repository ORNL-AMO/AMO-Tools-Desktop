        This calculator can be used to quantify the electricity saved from reducing compressed air system pressure. The
        benefits of lowering system pressure are twofold:
        <hr class="my-1">Reducing the pressure lowers the work done by the compressor and hence lesser electricity is
        drawn.
        <hr class="my-1">Reducing the pressure also lowers the amount of air delivered to plant and thus cuts down on
        the air lost in the form of artificial demand and air leaks.
        <hr class="my-1">
        This calculator only calculates the electricity saved at the compressors and hence its savings are not relevant
        when compressed air is brought from outside.
