      Cooling Tower Basin Heater Energy Help
      <br>
      <small class="text-muted">
        Determines cooling tower basin heater energy consumption based on ambient dry bulb, basin temperature setpoint and windspeed. Additionally, this calculator lets the user determine energy savings due to basin heater temperature setpoint optimization. This algorithm follows the methodology adopted by the eQuest energy simulation tool.
