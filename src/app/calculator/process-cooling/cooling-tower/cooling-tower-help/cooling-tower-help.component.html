                    entering a temperature difference.

                    Rate of evaporation has been assumed as 1% of the circulation flow for each 10°F of rise between
                    inlet and outlet across the tower. This can vary with operational conditions such as humidity. A
                    correction factor is used to adjust this. By default, that correction factor is 0.85. If the climate
                    is particularly moist, value may go down to 0.65; it if is very dry, it may go up to 1.0, or even
                    1.2.

                <small class="text-muted">
                    Water can be carried away from the tower in the form of mist or large droplets. Drift eliminators
                    can capture large water droplets in the air stream by changing droplets travel direction and
                    lowering their velocity and help droplets fall back into the cooling tower. Efficient drift
                    eliminators will keep drift losses to less than 0.001% of the re-circulating water flow rate.

                    The cycle of concentration can be determined by calculating the ratio of the concentration of
                    dissolved solids in the blowdown water compared to the make-up water. If the Cycles of Concentration
                    limit is set too low, water will be drained sooner than is necessary. If the Cycles of Concentration
                    limit is set too high, the cooling tower performance can be compromised by scale deposits on the
                    fill.
