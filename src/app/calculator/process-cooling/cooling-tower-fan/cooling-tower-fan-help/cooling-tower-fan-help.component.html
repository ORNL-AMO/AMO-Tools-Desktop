          The total number of independently controlled cells in the tower. A cell is the smallest tower component that can function as an independent unit with regard to air and water flow. They are contained by exterior or partition walls and each cell may have one or more fans and distribution systems.

          Choose control type for fan: 1-speed, 2-speed, or variable speed.
          <br>
          1-speed fan: A one-speed fan cycles on and off to maintain the tower setpoint. The program assumes that the fan can cycle as often as required to maintain the setpoint. In actual practice, fan cycling is usually limited to 4-8 cycles per hour to protect the motor from burnout. This can cause wide fluctuations in the condenser loop temperature, which the is not modeled.
          <br>
          2-speed fan: The fan cycles between off, low speed, and high speed to maintain the fluid setpoint.
          <br>
          Variable speed fan: The air flow is modulated so that the rejection capacity exactly matches the load at the desired setpoint. This option simulates both variable speed drives and variable pitch fans. Power consumption at reduced air flows is calculated using the FAN-KW-FSPEED curve from eQuest 3.65.
