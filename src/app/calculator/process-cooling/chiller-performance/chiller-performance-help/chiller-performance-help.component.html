          Choose the type of chiller. The chiller type is determined by the types of their compressors. Centrifugal chillers use centrifugal compressors and screw chillers use screw compressors.

        Condenser Cooling Type
        <small class="text-muted">
          <br>
          Choose the type of cooling used by the condenser. Air-cooled condensers dissipate heat from chiller's condenser directly to air. Water-colled condensers are typically connected to a condenser water loop with cooling towers and use cooling towers to dissipate heat to air.

        Compressor Config Type
        <small class="text-muted">
          <br>
          Choose the compressor configureation type. A variable speed drive on the motor allows the compressor to operate much more efficiently at partial loads than standard compressors. Chillers with magnetic bearing typically have higher energy efficiency because of lower bearing friction.

        Chiller Capacity @ ARI
        <small class="text-muted">
          <br>
          Chiller Capacity is  how much cooling a chiller is producing or is able to produce. To standardize the value, it is measured at a certain raited condition: The Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Institute (ARI) Chiller Capacity rating. The temperature conditions are based on the type of chiller: for water-cooled chillers use 44 F chilled water temperature; use 85 F condensing water temperature for water-cooled condensers; and use 95 F air temperature for air-cooled condensers.

To standardize the value, it is measured at a certain raited condition: The Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Institute (ARI) Chiller Capacity rating. The temperature conditions are based on the type of chiller: for water-cooled chillers use 44 F chilled water temperature; use 85 F condensing water temperature for water-cooled condensers; and use 95 F air temperature for air-cooled condensers.

        Design/Max Capacity Ratio
        <small class="text-muted">
          <br>
          Specifies the ratio of the design capacity to the maximum capacity.  The maximum capacity of a centrifugal chiller is often greater than the design capacity; either because of the components used to build up the chiller, or in order to meet the efficiency requirements at the specified conditions. For centrafugal compressors, 0.92 is a good first estimate.  This field is not applicable to screw chillers, please use 1.0.
