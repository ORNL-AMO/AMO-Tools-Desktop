      Heat Recovery From Condensing Heat Exchanger Help

      <small class="text-muted">
        This calculator can be used to calculate fuel savings resulting from boiler feed water economizer.  
        By installing a condensing economizer, companies can improve overall heat recovery and steam system efficiency by up to 10%. 
        A conventional feedwater economizer reduces steam boiler fuel requirements by transferring heat from the flue gas to the boiler feedwater, but 
        the flue gas cannot be cooled below about 250°F, to prevent condensation and possible stack or stack liner corrosion. 
        The condensing economizer improves waste heat recovery by cooling the flue gas below its dew point, which is about 135°F for products of combustion of natural gas. 
        The economizer reclaims both sensible heat from the flue gas and latent heat by condensing flue gas water vapor. 
        Condensing economizers require site-specific engineering and design, and a thorough understanding of the effect they will have on the existing steam system and water chemistry.
