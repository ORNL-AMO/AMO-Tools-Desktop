        Type of fuel used within the heating equipment or reaction chamber. The compositions and Heating Values of fuels are intended
        to represent "typical" compositions of these fuels. This tool can be made more accurate by using more accurate fuel
        compositions for your process. To add a new fuel , click "Add New Fuel". You can "start with existing fuel" and edit
        the composition or add a completely new material. You cannot use the name of a fuel already in the database.

      Savings Suggestions
      <br>
      <small class="text-muted">
        Maintain appropriate level of oxygen in stack gases by controlling air-fuel ratio for the burners.
        <hr> Maintain and control burner operations to eliminate formation of soot or combustible gases such as carbon monoxide.
        and hydrogen in stack gases.
        <hr> Consider use of heat recovery from stack gases. Consider use of various methods of heat recovery to reduce stack
        gas temperature leaving the heating system.
        <hr> Use preheated combustion air through use of recuperators or regenerators.
        <hr> Where appropriate, consider use of oxygen enrichment of combustion air to reduce mass of stack gases.
        <hr> Review process temperature settings and lower it where possible during part-load operations. This can reduce flustacke
        gas temperature leaving the heating system.
        <hr> Note: These energy saving measures are for guidance only. Not all measures are applicable under all operating conditions.
        There may additional measures when considering specific situations and the user is encouraged to review and apply
        the appropriate measures.
