              Maintain and control burner operations to eliminate formation of soot or combustible gases such as carbon

              Consider use of heat recovery from stack gases. Consider use of various methods of heat recovery to reduce
              stack
              gas temperature leaving the heating system.

              Use recuperators or regenerators to preheat combustion air
            </li>
            <li>
              Where appropriate, consider use of oxygen enrichment of combustion air to reduce mass of stack gases.
            </li>
            <li>
              Review process temperature settings and lower it where possible during part-load operations. This can reduce
              stack gas temperature leaving the heating system.

      Excess Air
      <br>
      <small class="text-muted">
        The excess air value represents excess air used in burners plus all air entering the furnace and going as flue gases form the furnace. 
        The value is expressed in terms of percentage of stoichiometric air required for the fuel used and can be calculated as the difference 
        between the measured O<sub>2</sub> and stoichiometric O<sub>2</sub> divided by the stoichiometric O<sub>2</sub>. 
        <br>
        This should be minimized while still ensuring adequate air for complete combustion. 
        The absolute maximum value depends on the fuel, with some natural gas mixes near 500% and coal closer to 100%.

        Higher O<sub>2</sub> in the exhaust indicates higher excess air and a greater amount of heat contained within the flue gas (lowering the available heat). 
        <br>
        Flue gas O<sub>2</sub> (dry basis) reading is taken at the same location where flue gas temperature is measured to maintain accuracy of the calculations. 
        For many applications this is less than 10%, though a few systems (e.g., thermal oxidizers, paint shop ovens) it may be higher, but still below 21%.
