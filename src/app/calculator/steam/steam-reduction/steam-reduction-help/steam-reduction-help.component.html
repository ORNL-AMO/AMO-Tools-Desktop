        This calculator can be used to quantify typical steam energy savings opportunities like:
        <hr class="my-1">Reduce the operation time of equipment which uses steam
        <hr class="my-1">Decrease the flow rate of the "fluid" being heated. (The most common "fluids" heated are water
        and air)
        <hr class="my-1">Reducing the operational hours of the boiler house
        <hr class="my-1">Changing set point to a lower temperature

      System Efficiency
      <small class="text-muted">
        <br>
        Specify the end-to-end steam system efficiency.
        <br>
        For onsite steam, boilers are typically 85% efficient, steam heat exchangers are typically 90% efficient. A
        process heat exchanger would have a system efficiency of 0.85 x 0.90 = 76.5%.
        <br>
        Losses will further reduce system efficiency and must also be taken into consideration.
        <br>
        For offsite generated steam, exclude the efficiency associated with steam production and only include the losses
        associated with the transmission and distribution.

        Choose the method to be used to determine steam consumption.
        <hr class="my-1">Flow Meter Method - The best way to measure natural gas consumption is with a flow meter. Pay
        attention to the units in the meter before entering data.
        <hr class="my-1">Mass Flow Method for Air - This method uses the mass flow of air heated by the steam to
        back-calculate the steam consumption. The mass flow of air can be determined either from a mass flow meter or
        using nameplate data. Using mass flow meter readings is much more accurate than the name plate readings. Mass
        flow calculations use ASHRAE accepted formulae to calculate consumption.
        <hr class="my-1">Mass Flow Method for Water – This method uses the mass flow of water heated by the steam to
        back-calculate the steam consumption. The mass flow of water can be determined either from a mass flow meter or
        using nameplate data.
        <hr class="my-1">Other Method – Choose this option if you are using an off sheet method to determine the steam
        consumption.
