        This tool is used to calculate energy and related cost saving when vent steam is used to heat domestic hot water. 
        This is achieved using a steam to water heat exchanger.  The calculator requires data on steam flow and steam
         conditions as well as water flow and inlet conditions.  The steam source can be deaerator water tanks, flash 
         steam from condensate return tank or any other equipment / process that vents steam into the atmosphere.
          Savings calculations are based on heat exchanger efficiency and reduction or elimination of energy cost 
          used to heat domestic water that will be heated by using vent steam.

        <div class="mt-3 alert-info p-3 small text-left">
          Additional energy savings are available on the steam/boiler side as vent steam is condensed back and recovered. 
          Makeup water is also saved in addition to the chemical treatment costs. To quantify the additional savings, 
          additional inputs of boiler efficiency, water and treatment costs, makeup water temperature are needed.
