        Valve Energy Loss Help

    <br>
    <small class="text-muted">
        Commonly, pumping systems are designed with an oversized pump which then has its flow restricted via valve
        to achieve the necessary flow rate. These valves are necessarily bleeding off fluid power to reduce the flow
        rate. As variable speed drives (VSD) are capable of adjusting the input energy of a pump and thusly
        adjusting the flow rate, there is potential to open a throttled valve and adjust fluid flow with VSD
        instead, thereby saving the energy that would’ve been lost through the valve.

        This calculator is intended to provide an estimate of electrical power loss incurred by throttled valves.

                This is a unitless term that influences the expressed flow resistance of the fittings and pipe geometry
                around the valve. For piping of the same diameter as the valve both in and out, Pipe Sizing Factor is 1.
                Typically, this value ranges only from 0.9 to 1.1, though extreme reductions or expansions can exceed
                this range. Derive experimentally if possible, else use 1.
