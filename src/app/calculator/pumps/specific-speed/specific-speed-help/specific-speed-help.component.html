    Specific Speed Help

    <small class="text-muted">
      For each pump type there is an optimal specific speed based on size, flow rate, and specific speed. Operation at the optimal
      specific speed allows a pump to operate at maximum efficiency. Hydraulic Institute standards also include factors for
      wear and surface finish on wetted parts that are not considered in these calculations.
