            <h3>Specific Speed Help</h3>
            <p>
              For each pump type there is an optimal specific speed based on size, flow rate, specific speed. Hydraulic Institute standards
              also include factors for wear and surface finish on wetted parts but these two factors are not considered in
              the PSAT calculations. Operation at the optimal specific speed allows a pump to operate at maximum efficiency.
              This calculator determines the specific speed for a pump at the given conditions and calculates the amount
              of efficiency penalty to be deducted from the maximum value due to operation away from the optimal specific
              speed.
