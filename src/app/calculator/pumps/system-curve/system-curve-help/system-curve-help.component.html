      A system-head curve is a graphical representation of the relationship between flow and hydraulic losses in a
      given piping
      system. Since hydraulic losses are functions of rate of flow, size and length of pipe, and size, number and type
      of
      fittings, each system has its own characteristic curve and specific values.

      A system resistance curve is a graphical representation of the relationship between flow and pressure losses in a
      given fan
      system. Some pressure losses are functions of rate of flow, size and length of duct, and size, number and type of
      fittings,
      each system has its own characteristic curve and specific values.
