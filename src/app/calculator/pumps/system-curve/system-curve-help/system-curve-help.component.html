      A system-head curve is a graphical representation of the relationship between flow and hydraulic losses in a
      given piping system. Since hydraulic losses are functions of rate of flow, size and length of pipe, and size, 
      number and type of fittings, each system has its own characteristic curve and specific values.

        is directly
        proportional to the specific gravity.

        Note 4: Fluid power is not interchangable with shaft or break/pump power.

      A system resistance curve is a graphical representation of the relationship between flow and pressure losses in a
      given fan system. Some pressure losses are functions of rate of flow, size and length of duct, and size, 
      number and type of fittings, each system has its own characteristic curve and specific values.
