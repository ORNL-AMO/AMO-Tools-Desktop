            A system resistance curve is a graphical representation of the relationship between flow and pressure losses
            in
            a
            given fan system. Some pressure losses are functions of rate of flow, size and length of duct, and size,
            number and type of fittings, each system has its own characteristic curve and specific values.

            Compressibility Factor
            <br>
            <small class="text-muted">
                The compressibility factor is the measure of how non-ideal the gas is. For most gases this is usually
                around
                1.

                The system loss exponent, or system friction loss exponent, is that to which the flow rate is raised in
                developing friction loss estimates. The Darcy-Weisbach equation, indicates a value of 2. Experiment with
                values
                between 1.8 and 2.0 to see how the system curve changes.

                delivered
                to multiple elevation or pressure systems.
                <hr> Note 3: The compressibility factor does not affect the system resistance curve, but does affect the
                fluid
                power, which is directly proportional to the compressibility factor.
                <hr>
                Note 4: Fluid power is not interchangable with shaft or break/pump power.
