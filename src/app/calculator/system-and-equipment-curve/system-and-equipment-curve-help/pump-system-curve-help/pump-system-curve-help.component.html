        <small class="text-muted">
            A system-head curve is a graphical representation of the relationship between flow and hydraulic losses in a
            given piping system. Since hydraulic losses are functions of rate of flow, size and length of pipe, and
            size,
            number and type of fittings, each system has its own characteristic curve and specific values.

            Specific Gravity
            <br>
            <small class="text-muted">
                Specific Gravity is the ratio of the density of the fluid to water at standard condition.
                <br>
                This is used in calculating the fluid power and can be found through fluid property tables.
                <br>
                By default, this calue is for water at standard conditions.

            <br>
            <small class="text-muted">
                The system loss exponent, or system friction loss exponent, is that to which the flow rate is raised
                in
                developing friction loss estimates. The Darcy-Weisbach equation, applied to pipes or fittings,
                indicates a value
                of 2. However, increasing Reynolds number causes the net effect to be slightly less than 2.
                <br>
                While the difference is generally not significant, the default value is 1.8. Experiment with values
                between 1.8
                and 2.0 to see how the system curve changes.
