    <small class="text-muted">
      <strong>NEMA</strong> (National Electrical Manufacturers Association) labeled electric motors are designed to assist purchasers
      in optimizing motor system efficiency, reducing electrical power consumption and costs, and improving system reliability.
      <br>
      <br>The predicted efficiency is based on a <strong>TEFC</strong> (Totally Enclosed, Fan-Cooled) Motor from NEMA MG1, 
      based on size, rotating speed and efficiency class.

          Motor RPM is the nameplate speed of the motor.
          <hr>
          This value is used with the line frequency to determine the number of motor poles. This, in turn, is
          used (along
          with motor class and size) to estimate motor efficiency and output shaft power for the measured
          electrical power
          or current conditions.
          <br>
          These calculators are based on curve fits to actual purchasable motors and motors in the original MotorMaster Database. 
          At the time of data collection, premium motors were only available in 2-, 4-, or 6- poles: 
          rpms lower than 900/1080 rpm extend past the bounds of the models and results may be inaccurate.

      Efficiency Class
      <br>
      <small class="text-muted">
        Efficiency Class is the classification of efficiency given to motor. This can be found either on the nameplate or
        based on how the motor compares with the NEMA MG 1-2003.
        <br><br>
        Efficiency Class options include Standard Efficiency, Energy Efficient, Premium Efficient, or Specified.
        <br><br>
        The Premium (IE3) and Energy Efficient (IE2) classes are based on motors that match those NEMA classes. Standard
        motors should be used if the efficiency is below Energy Efficient (IE2).
        If the user knows the full load efficiency, it can be directly entered using the "Specified" option. The motor
        efficiency at load will be calculated based on the same curves used for the other efficiency classes.

      Efficiency

      <small class="text-muted">
        If the user knows the full load efficiency of the motor, it can be entered here instead of estimated via the efficiency
        class.
        <br><br>
        Motor efficiency is the ratio between the amount of mechanical work the motor performs and the electrical power it
        consumes to do the work, represented by a percentage. A higher percentage represents a more efficient motor. Electric
        motor efficiency is dependent on (but not limited to) design, materials, construction, rating, load, power quality, and
        operating conditions. Enter this value as a percentage.
