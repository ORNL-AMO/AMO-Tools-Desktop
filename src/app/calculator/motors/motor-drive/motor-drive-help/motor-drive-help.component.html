      Adjust operating conditions to compare energy use and energy costs of different motor drive types.<br><br>
      Approximately one-third of the electric motors in the industrial and commercial sectors use belt drives most of which are V-belts, which can have a peak efficiency of 95% or more at the time of installation. Efficiency is dependent on pulley size, pulley wear, V-belt alignment, transmitted torque,  and under or oversizing belts for load requirements. Efficiency can deteriorate by as much as 5% over time if slippage occurs because the belt is not periodically retensioned, which requires downtime.<br><br>
      A notched belt has grooves or notches that run perpendicular to the beltâ€™s length, which reduces the bending resistance of the belt. They run cooler, last longer, and are about 2% more efficient than standard V-belts.<br><br>
      Synchronous belts are toothed and require the installation of mating grooved sprockets. These belts operate with a consistent efficiency of 98% and maintain their efficiency over a wide load range. On critical drives, a synchronous belt, which requires no retensioning, not only improves energy efficiency but also eliminates downtime.<br><br>

      Also called load factor, defined as the ratio between actual load and rated load. Maximum efficiency is usually near 75% of rated load. Overloaded motors can overheat and lose efficiency. Underloaded motors, those loaded below 50% of rated load, are inefficient and exhibit low power factor. Surveys of installed motors indicate that a large portion of motors in use are improperly loaded.
