    Replace Existing Motor - Efficiency Upgrade
    <br>
    <small class="text-muted">
      Improving the energy efficiency of an electric motor can save energy, reduce operating costs, and improve
      productivity. Usually,
      the annual energy cost of running a motor is many times greater than its initial purchase price. For this reason,
      even
      a small efficiency improvement in motors that are large or have high operating hours can make financial sense.
      Consider
      buying an energy-efficient motor in the following circumstances:
      <ul class="text-muted">
        <li> For all new installations</li>
        <li> When purchasing equipment packages</li>
        <li> When major modifications are made to the facility or process</li>
        <li> To replace oversized and underloaded motors</li>
        <li> As part of a preventive maintenance or energy conservation program </li>
      </ul>

      Efficiency of Existing Motor

      <small class="text-muted">
        Motor efficiency is the ratio between the amount of mechanical work the motor performs and the electrical power
        it consumes
        to do the work, represented by a percentage. A higher percentage represents a more efficient motor. Electric
        motor
        efficiency is dependent on (but not limited to) design, materials, construction, rating, load, power quality,
        and
        operating conditions. Enter this value as a percentage.

      <small class="text-muted">
        The ratio of the average load the motor draws when it is in operation to full rated load. Maximum efficiency is
        usually around
        75% with drastic decreases in efficiency below about 50%. If this is the case, consider replacing your motor
        with
        a correctly sized motor.

        Rewinding a motor usually comes with a loss in efficiency somewhere between 1 and 2%. When considering the
        choice between
        rewinding a standard efficiency motor or purchasing a new high efficiency motor, the difference in efficiency is
        around 4 to 5% in favor of the high efficiency motor, which will also have a much longer service life.
