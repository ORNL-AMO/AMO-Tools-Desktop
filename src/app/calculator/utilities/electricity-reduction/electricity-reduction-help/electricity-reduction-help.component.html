        Manufacturer's data on lights can be entered as if the measurements were done with a power meter.
        <hr class="my-1">Multimeter Reading - Multimeter measurements are the second most accurate means of measuring
        electrical consumption and are accurate for DC and for AC (When combined with the plant's uncorrected power
        factor).
        <hr class="my-1">Name Plate Data - Motor nameplate data can provide a reasonable estimation of the energy that
        motors are consuming but are not as accurate as a power meter. Nameplate data does not tell the user how
        heavily loaded the motor is.
        <hr class="my-1">Other Method – Choose this option if you are using a different method to find the electricity
        consumption.
