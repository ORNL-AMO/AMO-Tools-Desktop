        Choose the method to be used to determine natural gas consumption.
        <hr class="my-1">Flow Meter Method - The best way to measure natural gas consumption is with a flow meter. Pay
        attention to the units in the meter before entering data.
        <hr class="my-1">Mass Flow Method for Air - This method uses the mass flow of air heated by the natural gas to
        back-calculate the natural gas consumption. The mass flow of air can be determined either from a mass flow meter
        or using nameplate data. Using mass flow meter readings is much more accurate than the nameplate readings. Mass
        flow calculations use ASHRAE accepted formulae to calculate consumption.
        <hr class="my-1">Mass Flow Method for Water - This method uses the mass flow of water heated by the natural gas
        to back-calculate the natural gas consumption. The mass flow of water can be determined either from a mass flow
        meter or using nameplate data.
        <hr class="my-1">Other Method - Choose this option if you are using an off sheet method to determine the natural
        gas consumption.
