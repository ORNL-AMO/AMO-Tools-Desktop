              This calculator allows the user to enter either energy use information gathered from meters or design specifications (for
              fuel, electrotechnology or steam furnaces) to calculate energy use for multiple furnaces. This allows users
              to compare the relative energy use of furnaces within a facility to prioritize energy evaluations and efficiency
              improvements.

              The Combined Heat and Power (CHP) calculator is intended to help plant managers and other intended parties to conduct a very
              preliminary initial screening of the potential CHP cost savings at the facility based on - Annual Electricity
              Consumption, Annual Thermal Loads, Average Electricity and Fuel prices and Annual Operating hours. This calculator
              is not intended to estimate the economic performance of a specific CHP project, rather it is intended to only
              give the user an initial understanding of whether CHP has the potential to provide economic savings at their
              facility.

            <p>
              Low power factor means you’re not fully utilizing the electrical power you’re paying for and can contribute to equipment
              instability and failure, as well as significantly higher than necessary energy costs since it means that more current
              is required to perform the same amount of work. This calculator is used to identify the capacitance (in kVAR) required
              for improving the power factor to the proposed level.
