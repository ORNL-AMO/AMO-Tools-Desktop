        Power factor is defined as the ratio of real, useful power to the apparent power which must be supplied. The
        main cause of low power factor is inductive loads from motors. Low power factor causes you to inefficiently
        utilize the electrical power you’re paying for and can contribute to equipment instability and failure, as well
        as significantly higher than necessary energy costs.<br><br> The purpose of Power Factor Correction is to bring the power
        factor closer to a value of 1 by absorbing reactive power through adding capacitance. Sometimes, a utility will
        charge a ‘power factor fee’ for having a power factor lower than 0.95.<br><br> This calculator is used to identify the
        capacitance (in kVAR) required for improving the power factor to the proposed level.
