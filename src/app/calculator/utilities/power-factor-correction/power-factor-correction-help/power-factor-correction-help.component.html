    Power Factor Correction Help
    <br>
    <small class="text-muted"> Power factor is defined as the ratio of real, useful power to the apparent power which
      must be supplied. The main cause
      of low power factor is inductive loads from motors. Low power factor causes you to inefficiently utilize the
      electrical
      power you’re paying for and can contribute to equipment instability and failure, as well as significantly higher
      than
      necessary energy costs.
      <hr> The purpose of Power Factor Correction is to bring the power factor closer to a value of 1 by absorbing
      reactive power
      through adding capacitance. Sometimes, a utility will charge a ‘power factor fee’ for having a power factor lower
      than
      0.95.
      <hr> This calculator is used to identify the capacitance (in kVAR) required for improving the power factor to the
      proposed
      level.
