    Power Factor Triangle Help
    <br>
    <small class="text-muted">Power factor is the ratio of real (useful) power to the apparent power that your utility
      must supply. Low power factor means the utility must extra power to your facility. The main cause of low power
      factor in industrial facilities is inductive loads from partially loaded motors. You can be penalized for having a
      low power factor, significantly increasing your energy costs. Correcting your power factor can eliminate these
      penalties, increase load capability in existing circuits, and reduce power system losses.
      <hr>
      The purpose of Power Factor Correction is to raise your facility’s power factor closer to 1.0 by installing
      capacitance to counterbalance inductive loads. Many utilities charge a ‘power factor fee’ for having a power
      factor below a minimum level (often 0.95).

      This calculator can be used to calculate different aspects of the power factor triangle and explore how adjusting
      your power factor affects delivered power.

      Apparent Power
      <br>
      <small class="text-muted">
        The total amount of AC power delivered by the utility to your facility. The magnitude of apparent power can be
        found with the power factor triangle and the Pythagorean theorem. Apparent power is measured in kilovolt-ampere
        (kVA).

        The component of delivered AC power that does no work but is required to energize reactive loads like capacitors
        and inductors. Reactive power is measured in reactive kilovolt-ampere (kVAr).

        The angle between the current and voltage in an AC circuit. Phase angle can also be visualized as the angle

      Power Factor
      <br>
      <small class="text-muted">
        The ratio between real power that does work and the actual apparent power delivered by the utility. A low power
        factor means that your utility must supply a lot of extra energy to your facility to do the same amount of real
        work. Power factor is also the cosine of the phase angle.
