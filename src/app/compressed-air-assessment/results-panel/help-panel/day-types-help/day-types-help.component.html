        Day Types Help

        <small class="text-muted">
            Daytypes are used to group your daily operations into sets of simlar operating conditions. For example, if
            you operate 5 days a week, with simlar demand, you might have two daytypes: Weekday and Weekend.
            Here, you define how many days per year belong to each daytype and on the System Profile tab, you will enter
            your operating conditions for each compressor, for each daytype.
            You can use the Data Explorer Tool to analyze logger data and help determine both what your daytypes are and
            the operating conditions for the System Profile.
            If you are wanting to conduct a simple analysis, set all the days per year to one daytype and select a data
            interval of "24 hours" to only enter a single operating condition.
