            Blowdown Time
            <br>
            <small class="text-muted">
                The number of seconds required for a compressor to completely unload or to reach its
                fully unloaded power, or the number of seconds required for the sump pressure to
                decrease from the cut-out (unloading) pressure to the minimum unloaded sump
                pressure. This only applies to lubricant-injected rotary screw compressors with
                load/unload controls. Distinct from “drain-down time.”

            <small class="text-muted">
                The difference between the full-load and no-load discharge pressures (in pounds per square inch), if the
                air compressor has modulation controls.

                The inlet pressure for which the air compressor is designed, which is also the design pressure under
