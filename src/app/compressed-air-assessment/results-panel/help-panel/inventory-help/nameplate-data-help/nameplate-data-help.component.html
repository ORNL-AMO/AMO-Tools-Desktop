        Compressor Type
        <br>
        <small class="text-muted">
            A general description of the air compressor design and style. The compressor type options in MEASUR are:
            single stage lubricant-injected rotary screw, two stage lubricant-injected rotary screw, two stage
            lubricant-free rotary screw, single stage reciprocating, two stage reciprocating, and centrifugal.

        Motor Power

        <small class="text-muted">
            Either Motor Power (kW) or Motor Current (amps) will be displayed, depending on the Load Estimation
            Method selected. Power is the preferred measurement, but unless a permanently-installed power meter is
            available, it is much more intrusive and challenging.
