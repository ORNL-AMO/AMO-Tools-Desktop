                A general description of the air compressor design and style. The compressor type options in MEASUR are:
                single stage lubricant-injected rotary screw, two stage lubricant-injected rotary screw, two stage
                lubricant-free rotary screw, single stage reciprocating, two stage reciprocating, and centrifugal.

                Either Motor Power (kW) or Motor Current (amps) will be displayed, depending on the Load Estimation
                Method selected. Power is the preferred measurement, but unless a permanently-installed power meter is
                available, it is much more intrusive and challenging.

                The pressure at which the air compressor begins to deliver air; at this point, the compressor may reload
