                The operating pressure point where a compressor unloads. For centrifugal compresors, this is the surge

                A device that turns off a compressor after it has operated at no load for a specified length of time.
                This is different than on-off control, which turns off an air compressor when the full load discharge
                pressure is reached.

                A general description of the air compressorâ€™s unloading controls. Each compressor type can only have
                specific control types.
                Control Types options are based on your Baseline control type. The asterisk
                indicates the Baseline control type.
