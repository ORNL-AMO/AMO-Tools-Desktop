        Add Primary Receiver Volume Help

        <small class="text-muted">
            Models adding receiver volume. This can conserve energy by lengthening the compressor
            cycle time so that complete blowdown is achieved and the full benefits of unloading controls are
            realized.
            This is only available if air storage capacity was entered in System Basics. Only systems lubricant-injected
            screw compressors with unloading controls will benefit from adding receiver volume. Existing air storage
            capacity is entered in the System Basics - System Information tab.
