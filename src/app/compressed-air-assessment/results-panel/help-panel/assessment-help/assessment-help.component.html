                MEASUR will automatically reallocate your system's flow to match the compressor ordering established in
                the baseline, either via automatic cascading (according to the full load pressure of each compressor) or
                sequenced within the system profile.
                Each compressor is fully loaded before turning on the next in the sequence.
                The <i>flow reallocation savings</i> is the savings that would be realized if the compressors were
                operating as described in the baseline.

            Flow Reallocation Implementation Cost
            <br>
            <small class="text-muted">
                Estimated cost to implement flow reallocation.
                Flow reallocation is the first step before any EEM will be applied. The total of the flow for the system
                (for each hour) is distributed to the compressors based on the ordering in the baseline.
                For example, compressor 1 will be loaded 100%, the remaining flow would go to compressor 2, then so on
                until the original flow is fully distributed. If the baseline utilizes a base/trim sequencing, the trim
                compressor will be loaded last. This usually results in some sort of savings (though in some scenarios
                could cost more energy if compressor 1 is the most inefficient or if there isnâ€™t a shutdown timer).
                These savings may reflect the need to re-sequence the system's controls with a vendor or technician to
                avoid part-loaded compressors or installing advance system controls.
