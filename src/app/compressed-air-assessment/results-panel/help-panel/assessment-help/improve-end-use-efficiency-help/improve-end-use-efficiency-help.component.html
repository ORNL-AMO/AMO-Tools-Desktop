                Average power load of replacement equipment. If airflow is reduced by replacing an end use with a
                electric alternative (for example a pneumatic valve with an electric actuated valve), the savings will
                be the difference of the decreased compressor load and the additional electrical load.

                Average power required by new equipment. If airflow is reduced by replacing an end use device (for
                example a pneumatic valve with an electric actuated valve), that will decrease your compressor energy
                use, but increase your direct energy use.
