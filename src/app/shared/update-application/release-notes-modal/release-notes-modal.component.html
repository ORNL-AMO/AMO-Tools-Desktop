            MEASUR helps manufacturers increase industrial energy efficiency at the plant-level and in specific systems.
            Learn step-by-step
            ways to identify opportunities, monitor progress, and improve efficiency in any facility.
            Some tools help facilities implement an energy management system and prepare to become ISO 50001 and
            Superior Energy Performance certified. Based on
            older Department of Energy (DOE) tools, the Advanced Manufacturing Office (AMO) has undertaken this effort
            to refactor the legacy tools into a modern environment.
            The suite includes 7 energy system assessment modules, a Data Exploration Module, extensive help text,
            comprehensive reports, data visualization, and 80 calculators!

            MEASUR is a supported application, updates are expected and may impact previously created assessments.

          <ul>
            <li>Installing v1.0.0 or an earlier version of this tool will automatically reset your app data. Data can be

            <li>Do not install an earlier version of this tool without resetting your app data (in settings).</li>
            <li>If MEASUR freezes during installation or fails to install, uninstall the previous version of MEASUR and
              repeat installation of the new installer</li>
            <li>Assessments created in MEASUR 0.8.0 or later are not compatible with older versions. </li>
            <li>Exporting from v.0.8.0 and importing to a lower version will continue to work, though new features will
              not be available.</li>

          <label class="header-label">Here are the details of what's new in version 1.5.12:</label>
          <br>

          <label>Application</label>
          <ul>
            <li>Enhanced - Updated assessment naming scheme to replace references to “System setup” with “Baseline”. Modified description for EEMs</li>
            <li>Enhanced - Updated assessment view contexts to “Explore Opportunities” and “Expert View”</li>
          </ul>

          <label>Compressed Air</label>
          <ul>
            <li>Enhanced - Added Implementation Cost for Flow Reallocation EEM in Compressed Air Assessment</li>
            <li>Fixed - Compressed Air assessment End Uses and Inventory became unreachable if item name was empty</li>
          </ul>

          <label>Pumps</label>
          <ul>
            <li>Enhanced - Updated Pump Achievable Efficiency calculator to use MEASUR Tools Suite algorithm for optimal pump efficiency, including additional pump metrics</li>
          </ul>

          <label>Calculators</label>
          <ul>
            <li>Fixed - Added "Additional Cash Flows" to graph </li>
            <li>Updated - Cash Flow Calculator added full names for results in table </li>
          </ul>

          <label>Known Issues</label>
          <ul>
            <li>The Auto-update feature is currently unavailable for the Mac and Linux versions</li>
            <li>Renaming an export in Windows Download menu can delete the file extension (.json, or .gz)</li>
            <li>Assessments made in a previous major release may experience errors</li>
            <li>Import files made in a previous major release may not be useable due to field additions/removals</li>
            <li>We have observed cases where if MEASUR is open for a long period of time while many assessments are
              present, MEASUR performance can become slow. If experienced, close and reopen MEASUR</li>
