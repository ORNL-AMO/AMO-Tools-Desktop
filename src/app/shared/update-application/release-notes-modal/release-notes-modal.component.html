            MEASUR helps manufacturers increase industrial energy efficiency at the plant-level and in specific systems. 
            Learn step-by-step ways to identify opportunities, monitor progress, and improve efficiency in any facility. 
            Some tools help facilities implement an energy management system and prepare to become ISO 50001 and Superior Energy Performance certified. 
            Based on older Department of Energy (DOE) tools, the Industrial Technologies office (ITO, formerlly the Advanced Manufacturing Office, AMO) 
            has undertaken this effort to refactor the legacy tools into a modern environment. 
            The suite includes 8 assessment modules (6 energy system, the treasure hunt, and the water balance modules), a Data Exploration Module, extensive help text, comprehensive reports, data visualization, and 80 calculators!
          </p>
          <p class="card-text-small">
            MEASUR is a supported application, updates are expected and may impact previously created assessments.

          <ul>
            <li>Installing v1.0.0 or an earlier version of this tool will automatically reset your app data. Data can be
              imported into an earlier version from v1.0.0</li>
            <li>Do not install an earlier version of this tool without resetting your app data (in settings).</li>
            <li>If MEASUR freezes during installation or fails to install, uninstall the previous version of MEASUR and
              repeat installation of the new installer</li>
            <li>Assessments created in MEASUR 0.8.0 or later are not compatible with older versions. </li>
            <li>Exporting from v.0.8.0 and importing to a lower version will continue to work, though new features will
              not be available.</li>
