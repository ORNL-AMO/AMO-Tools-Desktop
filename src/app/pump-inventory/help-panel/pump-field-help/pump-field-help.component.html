    Pump Speed

      The operating or nameplate speed at which the pump is running at. Used along with the measure/required flow
      rate, head, and
      number of stages, to calculate the pump specific speed. The specific speed is used to determine efficiency
      penalty
      associated with the particular pump application.

        Flow rate for modified scenario. Should be determined from an analysis of required/desired modification flow
        rate or head, using manufacturer’s pump curve and the pump affinity laws to find accurate values.
        This is also used to calculate the optimal pump efficiency, if activated (must change the flow rate before
        calculating optimal pump efficiency).
