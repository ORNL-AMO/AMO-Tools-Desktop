        This drop-down selection menu allows the user to define whether the pump is direct driven by the motor or
        belt-driven. There
        are three options for belt drives: V-Belt, Notched V-Belt and Synchronous Belt Drives. Of the three, V-Belt
        drives
        are the least efficient, Notched V-Belts are slightly better, and Synchronous Belts are the most efficient
        belts.
        <br> This value is used in the Load Estimation calculation. Note: The current estimating method should NOT be
        used if
        adjustable frequency drives are used.
        <hr> Drive options include
        <u>Direct Drive</u>,
        <u>VSD</u>,
        <u>Belt Drive</u>, or
