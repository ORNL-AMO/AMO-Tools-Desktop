      <h2>AMO Tools Desktop</h2>
      <p>
        The Advanced Manufacturing Office (AMO) is an office within the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE).
        AMO supports R&D projects and consortia, as well as early-stage technical partnerships with national laboratories, companies (for-profit and not-for profit),
        research institutions, and universities through competitive, merit reviewed funding opportunities designed to investigate novel manufacturing technologies.<br>
        AMO’s tools were designed to help manufacturers increase industrial energy efficiency at the plant-level and for specific systems.
        Some tools help facilities implement an energy management system and prepare to become ISO 50001 and Superior Energy Performance certified.<br>
        This tool suite can help manufacturers improve the efficiency of specific systems and pieces of equipment within a plant.
        There are also several calculators that can be used independently for system parameter estimations
        and graphical analysis (e.g., estimate pump head, examine the pump-system curve, converting energy requirements for different heat sources).

              The Pumping System Assessment Tool (PSAT), originally developed by Don Casada of Diagnostic Solutions, LLC,
              is a free desktop software tool to evaluate the potential energy savings opportunities of pumping systems
              based on field-measured data. It is also intended to help industrial users assess different system modifications
              to determine which would be the most energetically beneficial.<br>
              PSAT uses achievable pump performance data from Hydraulic Institute standards and motor performance data
              from the MotorMaster+ database to calculate potential energy and associated cost savings.<br>
              The tool also enables users to save and retrieve log files for sharing analyses with other users,
              view an example scenario, and explore system and pump curves.

            </p>

            <h4>Inputs</h4>
            <p>To use PSAT, users must input the following data:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Pump style</li>
              <li>Number of stages</li>
              <li>Pump and motor speed(s)</li>
              <li>Motor nameplate ratings</li>
              <li>Operating duty (fraction of time the equipment runs at the specified condition)</li>
              <li>Energy cost rates</li>
              <li>Flow rate</li>
              <li>Pump head (calculated from user-supplied pressure and line dimensional data)</li>
              <li>Field motor electric power (or current) and voltage.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Outputs</h4>
            <p>Base on inputs, PSAT will provide the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Estimated pump and motor efficiencies and shaft powers for both existing and top-of-the-line commercially available
                equipment of "optimal" equipment</li>
              <li>Annual energy use and energy costs for existing and optimal equipment</li>
              <li>Potential annual energy savings</li>
              <li>Optimization rating, which is analogous to a grade (rating of 100 is consistent with top-of-the-line commercial
                equipment).
