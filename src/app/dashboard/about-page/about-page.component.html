      <p class="small">
        The Manufacturing Energy Assessment Software for Utility Reduction (MEASUR) is an open-source software suite for
        increasing the understanding of energy use and potential savings opportunities for industrial and commercial
        equipment. MEASUR is based on and will ultimately replace several of DOE’s legacy software tools.
        It leverages DOE’s extensive understanding of industrial energy use to help users better understand
        the energy use of their equipment. It also allows them to evaluate various energy-related “what-if” scenarios
        to quantify potential energy and cost savings.

      <p class="small">
        Assessments are organized in folders with unique or inherited information about the user’s facility. Users can
        save and send their assessments to other MEASUR users, regardless of their operating system. MEASUR can also
        generate individual assessment and roll up reports. There are also several calculators that can be used
        independently for system parameter estimations and graphical analysis (e.g., estimate pump head, examine the
        pump-system curve, converting energy requirements for different heat sources).
