        <h4>Release Notes v1.0.1</h4>

        <p>
          A software tool for calculating energy efficiency for a variety of industrial and manufacturing applications.
          MEASUR helps manufacturers increase industrial energy efficiency at the plant-level and in specific systems.
          Learn step-by-step ways to identify opportunities, monitor progress, and improve efficiency in any facility.
          Some tools help facilities implement an energy management system and prepare to become ISO 50001 and Superior
          Energy Performance certified. Based on older Department of Energy (DOE) tools, the Advanced Manufacturing
          Office (AMO) has undertaken this effort to refactor the legacy tools into a modern environment.
          The suite includes 7 energy system assessment modules, a Data Exploration Module, extensive help text,
          comprehensive reports, data visualization, and 72 calculators!
        </p>
        <p>
          MEASUR is a supported application, updates are expected and may impact previously created assessments.
        </p>
