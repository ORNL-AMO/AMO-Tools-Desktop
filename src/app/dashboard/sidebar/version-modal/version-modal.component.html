          A software tool for calculating energy efficiency for a variety of industrial and manufacturing applications.
          MEASUR helps manufacturers increase industrial energy efficiency at the plant-level and in specific systems.
          Learn step-by-step ways to identify opportunities, monitor progress, and improve efficiency in any facility.
          Some tools help facilities implement an energy management system and prepare to become ISO 50001 and Superior
          Energy Performance certified. Based on older Department of Energy (DOE) tools, the Advanced Manufacturing
          Office (AMO) has undertaken this effort to refactor the legacy tools into a modern environment.
          The suite includes 7 energy system assessment modules, a Data Exploration Module, extensive help text,
          comprehensive reports, data visualization, and 79 calculators!
        </p>
        <p>
          MEASUR is a supported application, updates are expected and may impact previously created assessments.
        </p>
        <label>Warnings</label>
        <ul>
          <li>Installing v1.0.0 or an earlier version of this tool will automatically reset your app data. Data can be
            imported into an earlier version from v1.0.0</li>
          <li>Do not install an earlier version of this tool without resetting your app data (in settings).</li>
          <li>If MEASUR freezes during installation or fails to install, uninstall the previous version of MEASUR and
            repeat installation of the new installer</li>
          <li>Assessments created in MEASUR 0.8.0 or later are not compatible with older versions. </li>
          <li>Exporting from v.0.8.0 and importing to a lower version will continue to work, though new features will
            not be available.</li>
        </ul>

      <label>Here are the details of what's new in version 1.5.2:</label>

          <li>Fixed: Bug relating to pipe and tank insulation calculators in metric conversion</li>
          <li>Fixed: Issue causing data entered in the Receiver Tanks fields for the System Capacity calculator to be slightly higher in Results</li>
          <li>Updated: Fixed several issues regarding the Steam Reduction Calculator and updated its algorithm to accommodate Fuel consumption better</li>
          <li>Updated: Power Factor Calculator now uses monthly data to estimate the capacitance required to improve power factor and the cost savings</li>
        </ul>

        <label>Data Explorer</label>
        <ul>
          <li>Enhancement: Graphs in Data Explorer can now have vertical and horizontal trace lines turned on in Plotly settings</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>Enhancement: EEMs now have the "Fill Right" functionality where appropriate</li>
          <li>Enhancement: The flow and power graphs now have a line to illustrate the peak</li>
          <li>Fixed: Compressors now use numeric ordering for the base/trim system control type</li>
          <li>Fixed: Issue regarding the display of Pressure Range for compressors with the VFD Control Type</li>
          <li>Fixed: Issue with CO2 emissions having tonne label but reported in kg</li>
        </ul>

        <label>Process Heating</label>
        <ul>
         <li>Fixed: Issue where emissions were calculated incorrectly if not using MMBtu or GJ for energy reporting</li>
        </ul>

        <label>Steam</label>
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed: Bug causing flashed condensate into LP header to not work</li>
        </ul>

        <label>Treasure Hunt</label>
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed: Issue where energy units were not converted if not using MMBtu or GJ for energy reporting</li>
        </ul>

        <label>Inventories</label>
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed: Error where Emissions were reported in kg but labeled as tonne</li>
