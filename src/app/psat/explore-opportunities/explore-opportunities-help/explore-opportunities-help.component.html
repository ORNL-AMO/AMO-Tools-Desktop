        There are several reasons to model a change to the pump’s efficiency. Installing a more efficient pump,
        restoring the existing pump, or changing the impeller size can all result in changes to the pump efficiency.
        Changing the pumps operating conditions (head, flow) can also result in a change to pump efficiency. Use your
