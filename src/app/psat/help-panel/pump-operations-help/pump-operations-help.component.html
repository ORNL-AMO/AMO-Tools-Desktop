                <br> The simplest approach is to simply divide the monthly (or annual) electric energy cost by the
                corresponding
                period's
                energy consumption, both of which are normally included in electric bills. It is recommended to include

                charges,
                power factor-related penalties, and other issues because they can have a significant impact on the the
                average
                per
                unit energy cost.
