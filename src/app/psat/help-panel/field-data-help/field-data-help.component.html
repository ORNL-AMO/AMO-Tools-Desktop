        Flow Rate represents either the
        <u>measured</u> or
        <u>required</u> rate of flow.
        <br> The Flow Rate value is used by the software to calculate the fluid power and to estimate the optimal pump
        operating
        efficiency.

        Flow rate for modified scenario. Should be determined from an analysis of required/desired modification flow
        rate or head, using manufacturer’s pump curve and the pump affinity laws to find accurate values.
        This is also used to calculate the optimal pump efficiency, if activated (must change the flow rate before
        calculating optimal pump efficiency).
