                This module is designed to help users establish daytypes for equipment analysis incorporating multiple
                operating
                types (e.g., Compressed Air Assessments). It also provides a robust Data Visualization component to
                allow users
                to create scatter plots and histograms of their data.

                    <li>
                        The first row of the data file MUST be column headers. Before importing logger data, the logger
                        header text must be removed from the file. This is often just a single row, but can be more.
                        Please use a spreadsheet or text editor software to remove these rows.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There is no restrictions on the column names (length/special characters). Columns can be renamed
                        within the Data Exploration tool if desired.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There is NO required data format (e.g., MM/DD/YY vs. DD-MM-YYYY)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Time stamps are required for the day type analysis
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Time stamps with seconds are required for some additional functionality of the module. Some
                        loggers do not save time stamps in this format. To correct this, open the file in another data
                        analysis software and change the format of the column to an appropriate format. (This is NOT
                        required for the day type analysis)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Data files with a large time stamp gap (i.e., months) will take a long time to parse. If your
                        data file takes several minutes to parse, there could be an error in your data (a single time
                        stamp from the year 1999). You may need to manually edit in a spreadsheet/text editor software.

                        These files do not need matching time stamps (though if there is a large time gap, it will take
