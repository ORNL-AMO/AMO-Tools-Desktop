            <small class="text-muted">
                Oxidizable nitrogen (N) concentration is for the activated sludge influent. In most cases, the
                oxidizable N will be the Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN) concentration of the activated sludge influent.
                The model assumes that most of the organic N in the activated sludge influent will be mineralized to
                ammonia-N in the process. The model will calculate the concentration of influent nitrogen that is
                incorporated in biomass production. Most of the remaining influent nitrogen will become effluent
                ammonia-N and effluent nitrate-N if the process has a sufficiently long SRT and is not operated to
                achieve significant denitrification. Typically, effluent dissolved organic N will be relatively low
                (often 1 mg/L or less), unless the activated sludge process receives significant loadings of inert
                dissolved organic N (e.g. certain amine groups from pulp, paper, paperboard, and cellulose production
                processes).
                <hr>
                Biological nitrification converts ammonia-N to nitrite-N and then to nitrate-N. In the model, nearly all
                of the ammonia-N that is converted to nitrite-N will be subsequently converted to nitrate-N. In
                activated sludge processes, a problem with the buildup of significant concentrations of nitrite-N
                (nitrite lock) can occur under some circumstances. In the Bio-Tiger model, the buildup of significant
                concentrations of nitrite-N is not considered.
                <hr>
                The oxidation of ammonia-N to nitrate-N (nitrification) is handled relatively simply in the Bio-Tiger
                model. Biokinetic equations <b>are not used</b> to predict the degree of nitrification in the process.
                Instead,
                empirically derived curves are used to determine the degree of nitrification based on the solids
                retention time (SRT) of the activated sludge process.
