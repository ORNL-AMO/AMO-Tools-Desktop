                        Reduce DO Concentration: operate aerobic reactors at lower DO concentration if possible (between
                        0.5 and 2.0 mg/L for most cases).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Match oxygen supply to oxygen demand while operating at the lowest acceptable DO concentration
                        by reducing aerator operating time, speed or power supplied (units on).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use an automatic DO control system to control the amount of aeration equipment in use at any
                        given time. Consider using luminescent or florescent DO probes. DO probes should be placed at
                        strategic locations in the aerobic reactor to ensure good process performance. Don’t use too
                        narrow a DO range so that aeration equipment does not cycle on and off too frequently.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Aerator: Consider replacing coarse bubble diffusers with fine bubble diffusers to increase
                        oxygen transfer rates by about 50%.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Reduce Aerator Speed: install variable frequency drives (VFDs) on aeration equipment.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Reduce operating time: use timers to start and stop aerators to conserve energy.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Reduce operating time: diurnal organic loading may allow for reduced aeration at night and
                        turning aeration off can promote denitrification, save energy, generate alkalinity, and may
                        improve sludge settleability.

            <small class="text-muted">
                Operating DO concentration impacts biological metabolism as well as performance of the aeration
                equipment. In most cases where aerobic metabolism is desired, the operating DO concentration should be
                in the range of 0.5 to 1.5 mg/L. If simultaneous nitrification/denitrification is desired, the operating
                DO concentration should be in the range of 0.0 to 0.3 mg/L.
                <hr>
                Operate aerobic reactors at lower DO concentration if possible. Aerobic reactors in activated sludge
                should have DO levels between 0.5 and 2.0 mg/L in most cases. Operating at DO levels above 2 mg/L should
                be avoided if possible. In most cases, maintaining a DO concentration above 2 mg/L is excessive and a
                waste of energy.

                <hr>
                However, oxygen demand at night should be about 60% of daytime oxygen demand due to diurnal organic
                loading in most municipal wastewater treatment applications. Thus, less aeration equipment may be able
                to be used at night.
                <hr>
                In extended aeration processes (extended aeration activated sludge and oxidation ditches) not designed
                for biological nutrient removal, consider turning aerators off 4 to 6 hours per day. It will promote
                denitrification, save energy, generate alkalinity, and may improve sludge settleability. If hydraulic
                detention time in the reactor is less than 12 hours, if influent TKN concentration exceeds 40 mg/L, or
                if effluent ammonia-N limit (monthly average) is 1 mg/L or less, on-off operation may not be feasible.

                Installing variable frequency drives (VFDs) on aeration equipment is especially useful for mechanical
                aerators and positive displacement (PD) blowers. It may not be practical on some types of centrifugal
                blowers; check with the blower manufacturer before installing VFDs. For mechanical aerators and PD
                blowers, speed typically should be 50% to 100%.

                An anoxic zone is used to remove nitrogen from the activated sludge, this occurs when the sludge is
