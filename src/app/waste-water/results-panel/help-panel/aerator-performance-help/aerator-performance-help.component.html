                Operating DO concentration impacts biological metabolism as well as performance of the aeration
                equipment. In most cases where aerobic metabolism is desired, the operating DO concentration should be
                in the range of 0.5 to 1.5 mg/L. If simultaneous nitrification/denitrification is desired, the operating
                DO concentration should be in the range of 0.0 to 0.3 mg/L.

                Standard oxygen transfer rate (SOTR) is the oxygen transfer rate in tap water at 20 °C, zero DO

                equipment at standard conditions to determine the SOTR. The design engineer must adjust the SOTR for
                field conditions.
