                In certain systems, it may be possible to raise the chilled water temperature without any negative results.  
                For example, in some industrial settings chilled water flow is throttled to reduce the flow rate for a particular process.  
                Instead of reducing the flow via valve control, significant energy savings may be possible if the full flow is used, but at an increased temperature.  
                In this case, the amount of cooling provided by the chilled water can remain unchanged.  A new chilled water supply temperature results in new chiller efficiency (kW/ton) for each load point.  
                Raising the chilled water temperature set point 1°F typically saves 1% to 2% of the chiller compressor energy.

            Condenser Water Temperature

            <small class="text-muted">
                Enter the target condenser water temperature after the EEM is implemented. 
                NOTE: When selecting to decrease the condenser water temperature, using a sliding condenser water temperature cannot be used and vice versa.
                <br><br>
                Lowering the condenser temperature results in less energy required in the compression cycle.  In water cooled systems, lowering the temperature is accomplished by increasing the speed 
                of the cooling tower fans or by increasing the number of cooling tower fans running, both of which increase cooling tower energy usage.  
                In air-cooled systems, lowering the condenser temperature is accomplished by operating the cooling fans more frequently.  There is a greater 
                potential for condenser temperature reduction in water cooled systems since the condenser cooling water temperature leaving the tower approaches the 
                ambient wet-bulb while the air-cooled temperature approaches the outdoor dry-bulb temperature.  At typical design conditions, a chiller 
                will consume five to ten times as much energy as the cooling tower and therefore trading increased cooling tower energy for more efficient chiller operation is frequently justified.
