            Do chiller load schedules vary?
            <br>
            <small class="text-muted">
                Select the appropriate option to determine if chiller load schedules vary. This question is relevant for multi-chiller systems that operate for extended periods with unequal chiller loading. 
                Select 'No' if the system employs a single chiller

            Condenser Cooling Method
            <br>
            <small class="text-muted">
                Chillers require cooling of the chiller condenser as part of the refrigeration cycle.  The condenser is typically cooled by a fan-driven air stream (Air-Cooled) or water flowing through a heat exchanger (Water-Cooled).  All chillers in the system are assumed to use the same condenser cooling method.  Select the method of cooling from the pull-down menu.
