        Following Temperature Differential
        <br>
        <small class="text-muted">
            This value is the difference between the condenser cooling water temperature achieved and the wet-bulb temperature of the air entering the cooling tower (the analysis assumes the condenser temperature achieved is equal to the cooling water temperature supplied to the chiller).  
            The closer the condenser water temperature approaches the air wet-bulb temperature through evaporation in the cooling tower, the more efficiently the chiller will operate.  
            Select the condenser following temperature differential from the pull-down menu.  Typical values are 7 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit, and the allowable range is 5 to 20.

        Is Condenser Water Temp Constant
        <br>
        <small class="text-muted">
            Water-cooled chilled water systems typically use a cooling tower to remove heat from the chiller condenser and reject it to the atmosphere.  
            Towers may operate to maintain a constant condenser cooling water temperature or allow the temperature to vary with the ambient conditions.  
            If the condenser water temperature entering the chiller is held constant, select 'Yes' from the pull-down menu.  If the condenser water temperature is allowed to vary, select 'No'.
