        Uses Free Cooling
        <br>
        <small class="text-muted">
            Indicates if the cooling tower system uses free cooling (heat exchanger bypass). Select <em>Yes</em> if the
            system is designed to use ambient conditions for cooling when possible.

        Is HEX Required
        <br>
        <small class="text-muted">
            Specifies if a heat exchanger (HEX) is required for free cooling operation. Select <em>Yes</em> if a HEX is
            present or required for your system's free cooling mode.

        <small class="text-muted">
            The temperature difference (in °F) between the process fluid and the cooling medium in the heat exchanger
            during free cooling. Typical range: 5–20°F.

        <small class="text-muted">
            The supported towers are '1-Cell with 1-Speed Motor', '1-Cell with 2-Speed Motor', '2-Cell with 1-Speed Motors', '2-Cell with 2-Speed Motors', '3-Cell with 1-Speed Motors', '3-Cell with 2-Speed Motors', and 'Tower with Variable Speed Motor(s)'.  
            By choosing one of the first six options, the number of cells per tower is automatically specified as 1, 2, or 3, where a cell is the number of identical zones (i.e. fans) operating within a cooling tower.  If the seventh option is selected, an additional menu appears at the bottom of the screen to specify the number of cells per tower.  It is believed that these seven options will cover the majority of cooling tower systems encountered.

        <small class="text-muted">
            The speed control type for the tower fans. Common values: 1 = Two Speed, 2 = Variable Speed. Refer to your
            system's fan control method.

        Tower Size Metric
        <br>
        <small class="text-muted">
             The tower size can be specified by tonnage, fan hp, or declared to be Unknown.
             Axial fans are usually found on larger towers, and are roughly twice as efficient as centrifugal fans.  The fan hp will be determined by multiplying the tower tonnage by a coefficient to arrive at a typical fan hp.
