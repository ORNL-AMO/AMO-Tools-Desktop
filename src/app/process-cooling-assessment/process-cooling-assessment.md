# Process Cooling Assessment
Adapted from Chilled Water System Analysis Tool 3.1

## Energy Efficiency Measures (EEMS)

### Original EEMs:
- Increase Chilled Water Temperature Setpoint
- Decrease Condenser Cooling Water Supply Temperature
- Use Sliding Condenser Water Temperature
- Apply Variable Speed Control to Chilled and/or Condenser Water Pump(s)
- Replace Chiller(s)
- Upgrade Cooling Tower Fan Speed Control
- Use Free Cooling when Possible
- Replace Chiller Refrigerant
- Install a VSD on each Centrifugal Compressor Motor
