        Blowdown Time
        <br>
        <small class="text-muted">
            The number of seconds required for a compressor to completely unload or to reach its
            fully unloaded power, or the number of seconds required for the sump pressure to
            decrease from the cut-out (unloading) pressure to the minimum unloaded sump
            pressure. This only applies to lubricant-injected rotary screw compressors with
            load/unload controls. Distinct from “drain-down time.”

        <small class="text-muted">
            The difference between the full-load and no-load discharge pressures (in pounds per square inch), if the

            The inlet pressure for which the air compressor is designed, which is also the design pressure under
            which the air compressor is rated.

            The power draw when the air compressor is fully modulated and delivering no air (expressed as a
            percentage of full-load power), if it is a lubricant injected air compressor with modulation controls.
