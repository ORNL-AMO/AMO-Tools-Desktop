          <li>Added: Ability to set if tutorials are on/off in General Settings</li>
          <li>Added: Print options for Rollup reports
          </li>
          <li>Enhanced: Ensured that values in Assessment Calculators are copied when copy the Assessment</li>
        </ul>
        <label>Pumps</label>
        <ul>
          <li>Added: Ability for users to define drive efficiency</li>
          <li>Added: Load Fraction and Drive Efficiency as results</li>
          <li>Enhanced: Electricity price defined in folder is applied to default value in new assessments</li>
