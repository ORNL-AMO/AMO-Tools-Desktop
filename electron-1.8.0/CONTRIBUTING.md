## Submitting Issues

* You can create an issue [here](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/new),
but before doing that please read the notes below and include as many details as
possible with your report. If you can, please include:
  * The version of Electron you are using
  * The operating system you are using
  * If applicable, what you were doing when the issue arose and what you
  expected to happen
* Other things that will help resolve your issue:
  * Screenshots and animated GIFs
  * Error output that appears in your terminal, dev tools or as an alert
  * Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues?utf8=âœ“&q=is%3Aissue+)
  to see if a similar issue has already been submitted

## Submitting Pull Requests

* Include screenshots and animated GIFs in your pull request whenever possible.
* Follow the JavaScript, C++, and Python [coding style defined in docs](/docs/development/coding-style.md).
* Write documentation in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown).
  See the [Documentation Styleguide](/docs/styleguide.md).
* Use short, present tense commit messages. See [Commit Message Styleguide](#git-commit-messages).

## Styleguides

### General Code

* End files with a newline.
* Place requires in the following order:
  * Built in Node Modules (such as `path`)
  * Built in Electron Modules (such as `ipc`, `app`)
  * Local Modules (using relative paths)
* Place class properties in the following order:
  * Class methods and properties (methods starting with a `@`)
  * Instance methods and properties
* Avoid platform-dependent code:
  * Use `path.join()` to concatenate filenames.
  * Use `os.tmpdir()` rather than `/tmp` when you need to reference the
    temporary directory.
* Using a plain `return` when returning explicitly at the end of a function.
  * Not `return null`, `return undefined`, `null`, or `undefined`

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally
* When only changing documentation, include `[ci skip]` in the commit description
