### Pull Requests

Pull requests to MEASUR are always welcome. We work hard to makes sure PRs are handled in a timely manner. As we are a small development team, we cannot promise a review or response within a specific timeline.

PRs should:

- Only fix or add the functionality in question.
- Address a single concern with a focus on readability and the minimum amount of implementation as possible
- Use a hashtag to connect the issue number it satisfies 
- Follow best practices for code style:
    - Contributors should do their best to follow the conventions of modern Angular, React, Typescript, and Javascript versions.
    - A project code and style conventions document is in progress. Maintainers acknowledge that legacy portions of the repository may not follow best practices for code styling conventions.
