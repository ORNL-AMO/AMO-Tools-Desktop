software_title: "MEASUR - Manufacturing Energy Assessment Software for Utility Reduction"
acronym: "MEASUR"
doi: "10.11578/dc.20220107.3"
description: "MEASUR your energy savings with the free DOE MEASUR software The Department\
  \ of Energy (DOE), with Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), released version 1.0\
  \ of their energy efficiency software tool MEASUR (Manufacturing Energy Assessment\
  \ Software for Utility Reduction). MEASUR has been available for several years as\
  \ a beta version, being tested by industry experts and real users, and will continue\
  \ to be updated and improved in the coming years. It is an integrated suite of tools\
  \ to aid manufacturers in improving the efficiency of energy systems and equipment\
  \ within a plant, including motors, pumps, fans, process heating, steam, and compressed\
  \ air. Additionally, there are modules for wastewater energy analysis and to help\
  \ perform energy treasure hunts. Several calculators are also included, allowing\
  \ users to independently perform smaller calculations and analyses (such as estimating\
  \ pump head, performing a fan traverse analysis, estimating waste heat recovery\
  \ potential, and cataloging compressed air leaks). The MEASUR modules are based\
  \ on previous DOE software tools that have been used by industry since the early\
  \ 2000s (such as MotorMaster, AirMaster+, PSAT, PHAST, and FSAT). The original tools\
  \ only ran on Windows operating systems, and by Windows 10, most of them were inoperable.\
  \ DOE started their energy efficiency software tool revitalization effort in 2016,\
  \ first with PSAT (for pumps), then began to integrate the other tools and expand\
  \ their functionality and utility. The new MEASUR suite provides an extensively\
  \ more user-friendly, modern, and versatile set of tools. All the assessment modules\
  \ and most of the calculators have several visual components and graphs and detailed\
  \ help text for every user input. To help reach international users, the tool utilizes\
  \ Google translate and users can easily change unit systems, even converting existing\
  \ user inputs if desired. The assessment files can be organized within the internal\
  \ file system and easily shared to other users, regardless of their operating system.\
  \ The entire suite is free, open-source, and can be downloaded on Windows, Mac,\
  \ or Linux operating systems."
