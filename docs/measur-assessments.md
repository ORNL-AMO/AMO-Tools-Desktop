## Conceptual Model: Baseline, Explore Opportunities, and Modification

### Baseline

The **Baseline** represents the current, real-world configuration and operation of your system. It is the starting point for all assessments and is used to establish a reference for energy use, system performance, and costs. All calculations and comparisons are anchored to this state.

- Captures actual system data and operating conditions.
- Used to quantify current energy consumption and identify inefficiencies.
- Serves as the reference for evaluating potential improvements.

### Modification

A **Modification** is a user-defined scenario that represents a change to the Baseline system. Modifications can be created to model specific upgrades, operational changes, or alternative configurations.

- Each modification is compared directly to the Baseline.
- Multiple modification (scenarios) can be created and analyzed.
- Enables detailed evaluation of proposed improvements.
- "Expert View" allows granular, advanced changes for experienced users.

#### Explore Opportunities (Modification)

**Explore Opportunities** is a guided, simplified view of the modification scenario designed for users who want to quickly test changes and see their impact. This mode is focused on key system parameters.

- Ideal for novice users or quick assessments.
- Provides immediate feedback on potential savings and performance improvements.
- Does not require detailed system modeling.
