## Specific Speed Calculator

### Field Name: Pump Type
Pump Type represents what style of pump is being used based off of the listings in the standard ANSI/HI 1.3-2000. This value will be used to estimate achievable pump efficiencies based on pump style and operating conditions.

#### Pump Types
- Overhung Impeller
- Between Bearings Impeller
- Vertical Turbine

Overhung impeller pumps have the impeller(s) mounted on the end of a shaft that is “overhung” from its bearing supports. The impeller can be mounted directly on the driver shaft or on a separate pump shaft supported by its own bearings.

Between Bearings pumps have the impeller(s) mounted on a shaft with bearings on both sides.

Vertically suspended pumps have an impeller with a vertical axis of rotation. Vertical turbine pumps typically use radial, modified radial or mixed flow impellers.

See ANSI/HI 1.1-1.2, 1.3, 2.1-2.2, 2.3 and 20.3 or Hydraulic Institute webpage for more information.

### Field Name: Pump Speed
The speed of the pump in revolutions per minute (rpm).

---

### Field Name: Flow Rate
Volume of liquid that travels through the pump in a given time (measured in gallons per minute or gpm).

---

### Field Name: Head
Head is the height at which a pump can raise water up.
