overview\n--------------\nGoal of v2.0 of the suite would be to remove all references to the Nan-bindings and move forward with creating a more publicly usable third party web assembly library. This will include enhanced documentation and examples. Additionally we want to be able to maintain the library in a way that keeps up with the latest changes to WebAssembly.\n\nBelow are the steps we should take (in order):\n1. Update compilation/build workflow (Omer)\n2. Fix and verify C++ unit test integrity (Mark)\n3. Created Archived, read-only AMO-Tools-Suite repo from existing (Omer) \n4. Create new repo for actively developed Suite repo - will be renamed (Gina, Omer)\n5. Update library used for js unit tests (Nick protoype + intern)\n6. Update doxygen related to wasm bindings\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ORNL-AMO/AMO-Tools-Suite/issues/700/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ORNL-AMO/AMO-Tools-Suite/issues/700/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ORNL-AMO/AMO-Tools-Suite/issues/679","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ORNL-AMO/AMO-Tools-Suite","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ORNL-AMO/AMO-Tools-Suite/issues/679/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ORNL-AMO/AMO-Tools-Suite/issues/679/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ORNL-AMO/AMO-Tools-Suite/issues/679/events","html_url":"https://github.com/ORNL-AMO/AMO-Tools-Suite/issues/679","id":1671847188,"node_id":"I_kwDOBIIhic5jpl0U","number":679,"title":"WASM Test checkup","user":{"login":"nbintertech","id":60401912,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNDAxOTEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60401912?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbintertech","html_url":"https://github.com/nbintertech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbintertech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbintertech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbintertech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbintertech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbintertech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbintertech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbintertech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbintertech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbintertech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":494867251,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0OTQ4NjcyNTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ORNL-AMO/AMO-Tools-Suite/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ee0701","default":true,"description":null},{"id":854024000,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTQwMjQwMDA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ORNL-AMO/AMO-Tools-Suite/labels/Application","name":"Application","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"nbintertech","id":60401912,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNDAxOTEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60401912?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbintertech","html_url":"https://github.com/nbintertech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbintertech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbintertech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbintertech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbintertech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbintertech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbintertech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbintertech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbintertech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbintertech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"nbintertech","id":60401912,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNDAxOTEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60401912?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbintertech","html_url":"https://github.com/nbintertech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbintertech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbintertech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbintertech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbintertech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbintertech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbintertech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbintertech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbintertech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbintertech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2023-04-17T19:34:23Z","updated_at":"2023-11-21T16:02:22Z","closed_at":"2023-11-21T16:02:22Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"1.

team needs a more complete, working resource instructing us how to perform suite builds and compilation, including below: \n\n**1. Development Environment** - We need to assess and outline the bare minimum environment needed to develop the project on Win, Mac, Linux. Are there any packages no longer needed? What is the easiest way for Win users specifically to use make/compile cpp, etc. Divide up process --> WASM way vs NAN way if any differences\n\n**2. Catch and Sqllite packages** - Need to check these and other libraries are up to date \n\n**3.  Running CPP unit tests** - Mark/Nick can no longer run them, possibly Gina as well. We need better documentation for the A) commands and B) development environment dependencies needed to run these. There will be a separate issue for fixing individual tests\n\nNote: We'll only need to develop using the WASM bindings from here on out, but any users of the legacy repo will need a working README to use that with legacy NAN bindings\n\n**Stretch goal:**\n- If the app could be containerized, that would be best. I was able to build from the current image about 75% of the way until it failed. Not sure if worth fixing the existing dockerfile though - possibly best to start

overview\n--------------\nCan we use the Steam properties calculator to estimate the enthalpy of water vapor in combustion?\n\n\nIssue details\n--------------\nFrom Keith Woodbury 2012/01/23\n  Regarding the latent heat loss:  I think the key is the approximation of the enthalpy of the water vapor in the exhaust.  The thermodynamic state of the vapor is highly superheated, but at the very low partial pressure of the water vapor in the exhaust.  For a practical ranges of fuels and %O2 in stack, the pressure of water vapor in the stack is between 0.5 and 2.0 psia.  Arvind approximates the enthalpy of the water vapor as SATURATED VAPOR at the PARTIAL PRESSURE of the vapor.  This does not take into account the variation of enthalpy  of the vapor with temperature (for low pressure ideal gases, such as air or water in atmospheric conditions, temperature, not pressure, is the main driver).    I did a few calculations in a spreadsheet (below) to illustrate the approximations.  \n  Also shown in the table (AIAC) are our internal representation for enthalpy of vapor in the stack.  We presently ignore the pressure dependence, and only use the enthalpy of SATURATED VAPOR at the STACK GAS TEMPERTURE.  It appears that at higher temperatures (beyond typical for boiler stack but not, perhaps, for high temperature furnaces), the effect of pressure becomes more important.\n\nThanks again for your help,\nKeith

overview\n--------------\nCan we use the Steam properties calculator to estimate the enthalpy of water vapor in combustion?\n\n\nIssue details\n--------------\nFrom Keith Woodbury 2012/01/23\n  Regarding the latent heat loss:  I think the key is the approximation of the enthalpy of the water vapor in the exhaust.  The thermodynamic state of the vapor is highly superheated, but at the very low partial pressure of the water vapor in the exhaust.  For a practical ranges of fuels and %O2 in stack, the pressure of water vapor in the stack is between 0.5 and 2.0 psia.  Arvind approximates the enthalpy of the water vapor as SATURATED VAPOR at the PARTIAL PRESSURE of the vapor.  This does not take into account the variation of enthalpy  of the vapor with temperature (for low pressure ideal gases, such as air or water in atmospheric conditions, temperature, not pressure, is the main driver).    I did a few calculations in a spreadsheet (below) to illustrate the approximations.  \n  Also shown in the table (AIAC) are our internal representation for enthalpy of vapor in the stack.  We presently ignore the pressure dependence, and only use the enthalpy of SATURATED VAPOR at the STACK GAS TEMPERTURE.  It appears that at higher temperatures (beyond typical for boiler stack but not, perhaps, for high temperature furnaces), the effect of pressure becomes more important.\n\nThanks again for your help,\nKeith

overview\n--------------\nGoal of v2.0 of the suite would be to remove all references to the Nan-bindings and move forward with creating a more publicly usable third party web assembly library. This will include enhanced documentation and examples. Additionally we want to be able to maintain the library in a way that keeps up with the latest changes to WebAssembly.\n\nBelow are the steps we should take (in order):\n1. Update compilation/build workflow (Omer)\n2. Fix and verify C++ unit test integrity (Mark)\n3. Created Archived, read-only AMO-Tools-Suite repo from existing (Omer) \n4. Create new repo for actively developed Suite repo - will be renamed (Gina, Omer)\n5. Update library used for js unit tests (Nick protoype + intern)\n6. Update doxygen related to wasm
